# React Native AsyncStorage Bug: String Instead of Object

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data.  The issue arises when retrieved data is unexpectedly returned as a string instead of an object, even if the original data was an object. This leads to errors when trying to access object properties.

## Bug Description
AsyncStorage's `getItem` method sometimes returns data as a stringified JSON representation of the stored object instead of parsing it back into a JavaScript object. This inconsistency causes type errors and application crashes.

## Solution
The solution involves explicitly parsing the retrieved string using `JSON.parse` before accessing properties.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the application on a simulator or device.
4. Observe the console output, noticing the inconsistent data type.

## Note
This inconsistency highlights the importance of robust error handling and data type validation when working with asynchronous storage mechanisms in React Native.
