This React Native bug occurs when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data. The issue is that the data retrieved from AsyncStorage is sometimes returned as a string instead of an object, even if the data was originally stored as an object. This causes unexpected behavior when trying to access object properties, leading to errors and crashes.

```javascript
// Storing data
AsyncStorage.setItem('userData', JSON.stringify({ name: 'John Doe', age: 30 }));

// Retrieving data
AsyncStorage.getItem('userData').then((data) => {
  // Data is sometimes a string instead of an object
  console.log(data); // Output might be "{"name":"John Doe","age":30}"
  console.log(data.name); // Throws error because data is a string
});
```
